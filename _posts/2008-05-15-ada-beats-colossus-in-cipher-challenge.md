I caught <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/15/1326237">this article on Slashdot</a> about an <a href="http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/207800151">Ada program beating Colossus</a> in a challenge to quickly decrypt messages from the <a href="http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/index.htm">Lorenz SZ42 cipher</a>.  The Ada program took 46 seconds versus what Colossus (the World War II machine in Bletchley Park that cracked German messages) solved in about three and a half hours.<br /><br />Ada has me very fascinated because I'm interested in programming languages that lend themselves to computational correctness and high execution speed.  I haven't used Ada, but I tend to hear good things about it, and would like to try using it next time I start a project.  I'm particularly interested in how it would help programs that use cryptography and that are going through a Common Criteria evaluation.<br /><br />According to the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE Index,</a> as of May 2008, Ada is sitting at #17 with 0.431% popularity and a rating of 'B'.  From that point of view it doesn't look like the hottest thing out there, but it has Objective-C (Mac's darling) way out-ranked.  Objective-C is #47 with 0.083% popularity, which makes me wonder if it's worth learning for writing Mac OS X Widgets.  Fortunately, Mac's Xcode provides some good hooks for Python (#7, 4.6% popularity) and Ruby (#10, 2.85%)...
