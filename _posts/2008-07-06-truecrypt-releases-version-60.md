On July 4th, 2008, the TrueCrypt Foundation <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=version-history">released TrueCrypt version 6.0</a>.  TrueCrypt is a very popular open-source disk encryption tool that is currently based on the XTS-AES encryption mode that the IEEE P1619 Task Group developed and standardized in December 2007.  As the chair of the <a href="http://siswg.net">IEEE Security in Storage Working Group</a> (SISWG) -- the group that oversaw the development of XTS -- I'm very pleased to see the continued adoption of XTS in the industry.<br /><br />On a related note, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/documents/Request-for-Public-Comment-on_XTS.pdf">NIST is currently considering XTS</a> as an Approved Mode of Operation for protecting U.S. government confidential data under FIPS 140-2.  If NIST accepts XTS, this will be a huge boon to TrueCrypt and similar tools that use XTS.  If you use TrueCrypt or other tools that use XTS, please send NIST a comment (before Sept 2008).<br /><br />For a limited time, you can pick up a <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1619tmp/1619-2007-NIST-Submission.pdf">free copy of XTS</a> from IEEE.  After September, you'll have to buy it from the IEEE store.  See the <a href="https://siswg.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=73">P1619 homepage</a> for instructions and other information.

    For those following this issue, now especially important under the HITECH Act, to avoid security breach reporting requirements for HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates -- TrueCrypt XES-AES has been approved by NIST with a few caveats. see http:/www.law2point0.com/
