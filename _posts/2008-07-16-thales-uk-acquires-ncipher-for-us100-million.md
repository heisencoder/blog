On July 11, 2008, Thales UK (a subsidiary of the French defense company <a href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/">Thales</a>)  submitted a proposal to acquire all the assets of nCipher for roughly US$100 million.  nCipher produces cryptographic hardware, and recently acquired most of the assets of NeoScale Systems for just under US$2 million.<br /><br />The deal is still pending a vote by the nCipher board, but the offer carries a 2x premium on previous stock prices, so it doesn't seem likely that this vote will fail.<br /><br />The technical editor for the <a href="https://siswg.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=76">IEEE P1619.3</a> was employed by NeoScale and is currently employed by nCipher, soon to be acquired by Thales.  nCipher is a strong supporter of the P1619.3 key management effort and I'm hoping that Thales will continue in this strong support.<br /><br />It's a little unclear to me how to pronounce "Thales".  The namesake is an ancient greek philosopher, and as such the name should be pronounced "Thay' - leaz".  However, the French owners prefer to pronounce it more like "Tal-less".<br /><br />Links:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://web.mac.com/jimhc/iWeb/Thales%20Press%20Release/Thales%20Press%20Release.html">Thales Press Release</a></li><li><a href="http://www.techworld.com/security/news/index.cfm?newsID=102139&pagtype=all">Techworld Coverage</a><br /></li></ul>
