    You found me!  And here I thought I was being inconspicuous...<BR/><BR/>I'm thinking about continuing this blog in the same vein as iDrone, with a slightly lower editorial expectation, and with higher volume.  After my new business gets set up, I'm hoping to devote a little time each day to blog maintenance.  (Of course, I said the same thing last year...).  But being self-employed, I'm hoping to have a little more free-time.  So far, I've just been busier than before.
