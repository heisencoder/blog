Here's an interesting paper on cryptographic key management:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bitsinfo.org/downloads/Publications%20Page/BITSEnterpriseKeyManagementMay2008.pdf">BITS: Enterprise Key Management</a><br /><br />Apparently, the <a href="http://www.x9.org/home">ANSI X9 group</a> is considering starting a standards effort based on the BITS whitepaper.  I think that key management is starting to get a little crowded for standards, but until one standard emerges as the most adopted in the industry, the hunting season is still open.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.keymanagementsummit.com/2008/">IEEE Key Management Summit</a> on September 23-24 (Baltimore, MD) has a 30-minute slot for ANSI X9, so we might be able to get more details then...
