I wanted to drop a quick note to let you know I'm still here.  Here's a quick run-down of what's happened to me over the last year:<br />
<br />
The biggest event is that Google hired me last October to work on a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/">Software Developer's Kit</a> (SDK) for the new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">Chrome Native Client </a>plugin.  This has been a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to seeing this technology go out to developers everywhere.  Native Client really has an opportunity to completely change the game, moving developers from Windows lock-in into being truly platform independent.  Cool stuff.<br />
<br />
We're also doing another <a href="http://2011.keymanagementsummit.org/">Key Management Summit</a>, this time in Monterey, California, from March 30-31st, 2011.  This is a follow-on to the previous IEEE Key Management Summits, held in 2008 and 2010.  This is a good chance to catch up on the latest development in key management technology and standards.<br />
<br />
I've also started competing at <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=22893359">Topcoder</a> as a way to sharpen my C++ skills.  I find it very useful to practice intense bursts of coding for 75 minutes.  I recommend it for anyone interested in pursuing coding jobs.<br />
<br />
So that's about it for now.
